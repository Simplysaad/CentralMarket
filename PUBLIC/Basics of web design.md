# Module 1: Introduction to web design

## Brief history of web design

### The Early Years (1990-1994)

The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. The first website was launched in 1991. Early web design was focused on functionality, with simple text-based layouts. The first web design tools were basic text editors and HTML editors like Adobe Pagemill.

### The Rise of Graphics (1995-1999)

The introduction of Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer led to the widespread adoption of the web. Web design became more visual, with the use of images, tables, and frames. Designers began to use software like Adobe Photoshop and Macromedia Dreamweaver. The first web design communities and forums emerged.

### The Dot-Com Bubble (2000-2002)

The web design industry experienced rapid growth, with many new companies and designers emerging. Web design became more sophisticated, with the use of JavaScript, DHTML, and Flash. The first Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress and Joomla were released.

### Web 2.0 and the Rise of Interactivity (2003-2007)

The web design industry shifted towards more interactive and dynamic websites. The use of AJAX, JavaScript libraries like jQuery, and CSS frameworks like Blueprint became widespread. Web design communities like Behance and Dribbble emerged.

### The Mobile Revolution (2008-2012)

The introduction of the iPhone and other mobile devices led to a shift towards mobile-friendly web design. Responsive web design became a best practice, with designers using media queries and flexible grids. The use of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript frameworks like Backbone.js and Angular.js became more widespread.

### The Modern Web (2013-Present)

Web design continues to evolve, with a focus on user experience, accessibility, and performance. The use of design systems, CSS grids, and JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue.js has become more widespread. Web design communities like Webflow and Figma have emerged, making it easier for designers to collaborate and build websites.

## Importance of web design

Web design plays a crucial role in the success of a website and can have a significant impact on a business or organization's online presence. Here are some of the key importance of web design:

**1. First Impression**

Your website is often the first impression people have of your business or organization. A well-designed website can create a positive first impression, while a poorly designed website can create a negative one.

**2. User Experience**

Web design plays a critical role in determining the user experience of a website. A well-designed website should be easy to navigate, have clear and concise content, and be optimized for different devices and screen sizes.

**3. Credibility and Trust**

A professional-looking website can help establish credibility and trust with your target audience. A well-designed website can convey a sense of professionalism, expertise, and quality.

**4. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**

Web design can also impact a website's search engine ranking. A well-designed website should be optimized for search engines, with features like fast loading times, mobile responsiveness, and clear and concise content.

**5. Conversion Rates**

Web design can also impact conversion rates. A well-designed website should be optimized for conversions, with clear calls-to-action, prominent placement of key information, and a user-friendly interface.

**6. Branding**

Web design can also play a critical role in branding. A well-designed website should reflect a company's brand identity, including its logo, color scheme, typography, and overall visual style.

**7. Accessibility**

Web design can also impact accessibility. A well-designed website should be accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. This includes features like clear navigation, high contrast colors, and compatibility with screen readers.

# Module 2: Fundamentals of HTML

## Introduction to HTML

**What is HTML?**

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard markup language used to create web pages. It is the backbone of a website, providing the structure and content that the web browser renders to the user.

**Basic HTML Concepts**

Here are some basic HTML concepts:

**1. Elements**

HTML elements are represented by tags, which are surrounded by angle brackets (`<` and `>`). Tags usually come in pairs, with the opening tag preceding the content and the closing tag following the content.

**2. Tags**

HTML tags are used to define the structure and content of a web page. There are two types of tags:

-   \*_Opening ttag_: This tag indicates the start of an element. It is surrounded by angle brackets (`<` and `>`).
-   **Closing tag**: This tag indicates the end of an element. It is similar to the opening tag, but it has a forward slash (`/`) before the tag name.

**3. Attributes**

HTML attributes provide additional information about an element. They are added to the opening tag and consist of a name and a value.

**Basic HTML Structure**

Here is the basic structure of an HTML document:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Page content -->
</body>
</html>
```

Let me explain what each part does:

-   `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This is the document type declaration, which tells the browser that this is an HTML document.
-   `<html>`: This is the root element of the HTML document.
-   `<head>`: This element contains metadata about the document, such as the title, character encoding, and links to external stylesheets or scripts.
-   `<title>`: This sets the title of the page, which appears in the browser's title bar and in search engine results.
-   `<body>`: This element contains the content of the HTML document.

**Common HTML Elements**

Here are some common HTML elements:

-   **Headings**: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.
-   **Paragraphs**: `<p>`
-   **Links**: `<a>`
-   **Images**: `<img>`
-   **Lists**: `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`
-   **Tables**: `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`

## Basic HTML structures (tags, elements and Attributes)

**HTML Tags: The Labels**

Imagine you're organizing a big box of toys. You need labels to know what's inside each box. HTML tags are like those labels. They help the web browser understand what's inside the tag.

**HTML Elements: The Boxes**

The toys inside the box are like HTML elements. They're the actual content that you want to display on your website. Elements can be text, images, videos, or even other elements.

**HTML Attributes: The Extra Information**

Now, imagine you have a toy box labeled "Blocks." But you also want to note that it's a special box for building castles. You can add a sticky note to the box with that extra information. HTML attributes are like those sticky notes. They provide extra information about an element, like its size, color, or behavior.

Here's an example:

`<p style="color:blue;">Hello World!</p>`

In this example:

-   `<p>` is the opening tag (label) for a paragraph element.
-   `Hello World!` is the content (toys) inside the paragraph element.
-   `style="color:blue;"` is an attribute (sticky note) that adds extra information to the paragraph element, specifically setting its text color to blue.
-   `</p>` is the closing tag (label) for the paragraph element.

## Headings, paragraphs, links and images

### **Headings**

Headings are like the titles of a book. They help break up the content and make it easier to read.

Imagine you're writing a recipe book. You'd use headings to separate the different sections, like "Ingredients," "Instructions," and "Tips."

In HTML, headings are represented by the `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>` tags. The number in the tag indicates the level of importance, with `<h1>` being the most important.

### **Paragraphs**

Paragraphs are like the text in a book. They contain the main content of your website.

In HTML, paragraphs are represented by the `<p>` tag.

### **Links**

Links are like the references in a book. They help you navigate to other pages or websites.

Imagine you're reading a book about travel, and you want to learn more about a specific destination. A link would take you to another page or website with more information.

In HTML, links are represented by the `<a>` tag. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the link.

### **Images**

Images are like the pictures in a book. They help illustrate your content and make it more engaging.

Imagine you're reading a cookbook, and you want to see what the finished dish looks like. An image would show you the picture.

In HTML, images are represented by the `<img>` tag. The `src` attribute specifies the URL of the image file.

Here's an example of how you might use these elements together:

```
<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
<p>Here's a
  <a href="example.com">
   link to another website
  </a>
</p>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image on my website">
```

## Lists, Tables and Forms

### _Lists_

Imagine you're making a grocery list. You'd write down each item on a separate line, right? HTML lists work the same way.

There are three types of lists in HTML:

1. _Ordered lists_ (`<ol>`) are like numbered lists. You use them when the order of the items matters.
2. _Unordered lists_ (`<ul>`) are like bulleted lists. You use them when the order of the items doesn't matter.
3. _Definition lists_ (`<dl>`) are like lists of terms and definitions. You use them to define terms or phrases.

Example:

```
<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
```

### _Tables_

Imagine you're creating a schedule or a chart. You'd use a table to organize the information, right? HTML tables work the same way.

In HTML, you use the `<table>` tag to create a table. You can add rows (`<tr>`) and columns (`<td>`) to the table.

Example:

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Name</td>
    <td>Age</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>John</td>
    <td>30</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

### _Forms_

Imagine you're filling out a survey or a registration form. You'd enter your information into fields and click a button to submit it, right? HTML forms work the same way.

In HTML, you use the `<form>` tag to create a form. You can add fields (`<input>`) and buttons (`<button>`) to the form.

Example:

```
<form>
  <label>Name:</label>
  <input type="text" name="name">
  <button>Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Semantic HTML

### _What is Semantic HTML?_

Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML code that gives meaning to the structure of web pages. It's about using HTML tags to describe the content and purpose of each element, rather than just its appearance.

### _Why is Semantic HTML Important?_

Semantic HTML is important for several reasons:

1. _Accessibility_: Semantic HTML helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the structure and content of web pages, making them more accessible to people with disabilities.
2. _Search Engine Optimization (SEO)_: Semantic HTML helps search engines understand the content and structure of web pages, which can improve their ranking in search results.
3. _Easier Maintenance_: Semantic HTML makes it easier to maintain and update web pages, as the structure and content of the page are clearly defined.
4. _Better User Experience_: Semantic HTML can improve the user experience by providing a clear and consistent structure for web pages.

### _Common Semantic HTML Elements_

Here are some common semantic HTML elements:

1. `<header>`: Defines the header section of a web page or section.
2. `<nav>`: Defines a navigation section.
3. `<main>`: Defines the main content section of a web page.
4. `<section>`: Defines a self-contained section of related content.
5. `<article>`: Defines an independent piece of content, such as a blog post or news article.
6. `<aside>`: Defines a section of content that is related to the main content, but not essential to it.
7. `<footer>`: Defines the footer section of a web page or section.

### _Best Practices for Using Semantic HTML_

Here are some best practices for using semantic HTML:

1. _Use the correct element for the job_: Choose the HTML element that best describes the content and purpose of the element.
2. _Avoid using generic elements_: Avoid using generic elements like `<div>` and `<span>` when a more specific element is available.
3. _Use ARIA attributes_: Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to provide additional information about the structure and content of web pages.
4. _Test for accessibility_: Test your web pages for accessibility using tools like screen readers and accessibility audits.


# Module 3: CSS basics

## Introduction to CSS

### _CSS: What is it?_

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's a styling language used to control the layout and appearance of web pages written in HTML or XML.

### _How Does CSS Work?_

CSS works by selecting elements on a web page and applying styles to them. These styles can include things like:

- Colors and backgrounds
- Fonts and text styles
- Layout and positioning
- Borders and padding
- Animations and transitions

### _CSS Syntax_

CSS syntax is made up of three parts:

1. _Selector_: This is the part of the CSS rule that selects the element(s) to be styled.
2. _Property_: This is the part of the CSS rule that specifies the style to be applied.
3. _Value_: This is the part of the CSS rule that specifies the value of the property.

### _Example of CSS Syntax_

`h1 { color: blue; }`

- `h1` is the selector (it selects all h1 elements on the page)
- `color` is the property (it specifies the color of the text)
- `blue` is the value (it specifies the actual color to be used)

### _CSS Types_

There are three methods to use CSS jn your project:

1. _Internal CSS_: This type of CSS is written directly in the HTML document.
example: 
``` 
<style>
 /* your styles go here */
</style>
```
2. _Inline CSS_: This type of CSS is written directly in the HTML element.
example:
`<p style="color: green"> hello world </p>`
3. _External CSS_: This type of CSS is written in a separate file and linked to the HTML document.

### _Benefits of CSS_

Using CSS has many benefits, including:

- _Separation of Concerns_: CSS separates the presentation of a document from its structure, making it easier to maintain and update.
- _Improved Layout_: CSS allows for more precise control over the layout of a document.
- _Faster Development_: CSS can save time and effort in the development process by allowing designers to make changes to the layout and appearance of a document without having to modify the HTML.


## Selectors, properties and values

### _Selectors_

Selectors are used to target specific elements on a web page. There are several types of selectors, including:

1. *Element Selectors*: Select elements based on their tag name (e.g. `h1`, `p`, `img`).
2. *Class Selectors*: Select elements based on their class attribute (e.g. `.header`, `.footer`).
3. *ID Selectors*: Select elements based on their ID attribute (e.g. `#header`, `#footer`).
4. *Attribute Selectors*: Select elements based on their attributes (e.g. `[hreflang]`, `[title]`).
5. *Pseudo-Class Selectors*: Select elements based on their state (e.g. `:hover`, `:active`).

### _Properties_

Properties are the characteristics of an element that can be styled. Some common properties include:

1. *Color*: Sets the color of an element's text or background.
2. *Font*: Sets the font family, size, and style of an element's text.
3. *Background*: Sets the background color, image, or gradient of an element.
4. *Border*: Sets the border width, style, and color of an element.
5. *Padding*: Sets the padding (space between content and border) of an element.

### _Values_

Values are the specific values assigned to a property. For example:

1. *Color Values*: `#FF0000`, `red`, `rgb(255, 0, 0)`.
2. *Font Values*: `Arial`, `Helvetica`, `16px`.
3. *Background Values*: `#FFFFFF`, `url(image.jpg)`, `linear-gradient(#FF0000, #00FF00)`.

_Example_

`h1 { color: #FF0000; font-size: 36px; }`

- `h1` is the selector (targets all h1 elements).
- `color` and `font-size` are properties.
- `#FF0000` and `36px` are values.
